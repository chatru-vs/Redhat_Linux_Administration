Use the credentials and server IP to log in to our lab server. Run sudo -i to become root once you've logged in.

We've been tasked with creating a large logical volume out of the two disks attached to this server. The Volume Group name should be RHCSA. The Logical Volume name should be pinehead and should be 3 GB in size.

Make sure that the resulting logical volume is formatted as XFS and persistently mounted at /mnt/lvol.

After that is complete, we should grow the logical volume and the filesystem by 200 MB.

Create Physical Devices

    Get the names of our disks:

    fdisk -l

    Create the physical devices:

    pvcreate /dev/xvdg /dev/xvdf

check_circle
Create a Volume Group

Create a volume group on the physical devices we created in the previous task:

vgcreate RHCSA /dev/xvdg /dev/xvdf

check_circle
Create a Logical Volume

Create the Logical Volume:

lvcreate -n pinehead -L 3G RHCSA

    -n denotes the name of the LV.
    -L denotes the size of the LV.
    RHCSA is the name of the volume group we're creating this LV in.

Format the LV as XFS and Mount It Persistently at `/mnt/lvol`

    Format the disk as XFS:

    mkfs.xfs /dev/mapper/RHCSA-pinehead

    Create a mount point:

    mkdir /mnt/lvol

    Get the UUID:

    blkid

    Copy the UUID, and edit /etc/fstab.

    Create a new line that looks like:

    UUID="THE-UUID-YOU-COPIED" /mnt/lvol xfs defaults 0 0

    Save and exit, and then run:

    mount -a

check_circle
Grow the Mount Point by 200 MB

    To grow the LV, run:

    lvextend -L+200M /dev/RHCSA/pinehead

    To have the LVM tools automatically resize the filesystem, you could pass the -r or --resizefs flags.

    Another way to resize the filesystem is by running:

    xfs_growfs /mnt/lvol
