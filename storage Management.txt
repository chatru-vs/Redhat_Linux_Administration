Additional Information and Resources

There are two disks advertised to this server. You've been tasked with setting one up with a GPT partition table and allocating 2GB to a single partition. The other needs to be a MBR partition with a 2GB partition.

Note: The Block devices have changed for the lab environment. To see the available block devices to use, run: lsblk The commands in the lab instructions have been updated for the new change.

Create a 2 GB GPT Partition

    Create the partition:

    gdisk /dev/nvme1n1

    Enter n to create a new partition.

    Accept the default for the partition number.

    Accept the default for the starting sector.

    For the ending sector, enter +2G to create a 2 GB partition.

    Accept the default partition type.

    Enter w to write the partition information.

    Enter y to proceed.

    Finalize the settings:

    partprobe

check_circle
Create a 2 GB MBR Partition

    Create the partition:

    fdisk /dev/nvme2n1

        Enter n to create a new partition.

        Accept the default partition type.

        Accept the default for the partition number.

        Accept the default for the starting sector.

        For the ending sector, type +2G to create a 2 GB partition.

        Enter w to write the partition information.

        Finalize the settings:

    partprobe

check_circle
Format the GPT Partition with XFS and Mount the Device persistently

    Format the partition:

    mkfs.xfs /dev/nvme1n1p1

Getting It Ready for Mounting

    Run the following:

    blkid

    Copy the UUID of the partition at /dev/nvme1n1p1.

    Open the /etc/fstab file:

    vim /etc/fstab

    Add the following, replacing <UUID> with the UUID you just copied:

    UUID="<UUID>" /mnt/gptxfs xfs defaults 0 0

    Save and exit the file by pressing Escape followed by :wq.

Create a Mount Point

    Create the mount point we specified in fstab:

    mkdir /mnt/gptxfs

    Mount everything that's described in fstab:

    mount -a

check_circle
Format the MBR Partition with ext4 and Mount the Device.
Format the MBR Partition with ext4 and Mount the Device on /mnt/mbrext4

    Format the partition:

    mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme2n1p1

Create a Mount Point

    Create the mount point:

    mkdir /mnt/mbrext4

    Mount it:

    mount /dev/nvme2n1p1 /mnt/mbrext4

    Check that it's mounted:

    mount

    The partition should be listed in the output.

    Mount the disk:

    mount /dev/nvme2n1p1 /mnt/mbrext4
